# 🧠 OCD Patient Dataset: Demographics & Clinical Data

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing clinical and demographic data of patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The objective is to identify trends and relationships in patient characteristics, symptom severity, and treatment outcomes using data science and visualization techniques.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes anonymized records of OCD patients with features such as:

- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Education level**
- **Marital status**
- **Age of onset**
- **Duration of illness**
- **Severity of symptoms**
- **Comorbidities**
- **Treatment details**

> Note: The dataset was used solely for academic and educational purposes.

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Imported dataset (CSV format).
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, standardized column names.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Used statistical tools and visualizations to find patterns.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Created relevant categorical/numerical features.
5. **Visualization** – Age distribution, gender ratio, correlation heatmaps, symptom severity vs treatment outcomes, etc.
6. **Insights & Conclusions** – Highlighted medical/demographic factors influencing OCD progression.
